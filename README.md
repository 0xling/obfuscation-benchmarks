# Obfuscation Benchmarks

By *Obfuscation Benchmarks* we mean programs which can be obfuscated using different tools at: source code, intermediate representation and/or machine code level.
The reason for obfuscating these programs can be (but is not limited) to compare the strength of different obfuscation transformations/implementations against both human-assisted and automated attacks. 
This repository contains the source code of C programs, which can be used as obfuscation benchmarks. 

## Description of Each Directory

  - `basic-algorithms` contains typical algorithms taught in Bachelor level computer science and programming courses, e.g. factorial, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, greatest common divisor, least common multiple, etc.
  - `simple-hash-functions` contains non-cryptographic hash functions 
  - `small-programs` contains a set of 48 programs with few lines of code constructed by varying the following code characteristics:
    - Range of symbolic inputs
    - Number of symbolic inputs
    - Depth of nested control flow
    - Number of IF-statements
    - Number of input dependent IF-statements
    - Type of IF-condition
    - Number of loops
    - Number of input length dependent loops (e.g. if the input is 10 characters long, then the loop has 10 iterations)
    - Number of input value dependent loops (e.g. if the input is an integer equal to 100, then the loop has 100 iterations)
  - `tigress-generated-programs` contains a large set of programs automatically generated by the `RandomFuns` transformation of the [Tigress C Diversifier/Obfuscator](http://tigress.cs.arizona.edu/) by varying the following command line options:
    - `Seed` randomization seed
    - `RandomFunsTypes` data type of variables
    - `RandomFuns Operators` types of operators (e.g. arithmetic, logic)
    - `RandomFunsControlStructures` control structure of the program
    - `RandomFunsBasicBlockSize` the number of statements in each basic block
    - `RandomFunsForBound` the type of bound in loop conditions (e.g. constant, input dependent)
